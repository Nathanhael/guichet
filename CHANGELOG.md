## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Auto-status on idle** — support/admin users auto-set to Break after 5 minutes of inactivity, restores previous status on activity
- **PWA push notifications for agents** — Web Push alerts for ticket replies, status changes, support joining, and rating requests (background-only, bell icon opt-in)
- **`useIdleStatus` hook** with configurable timeout and activity detection (mouse, keyboard, touch, scroll, visibility)
- **Push notification service** with VAPID authentication and automatic cleanup of expired subscriptions
- **`push_subscriptions` database table** for Web Push subscription storage
- **Department-based ticket transfer** — Transfer tickets to departments instead of individual agents, with optional whisper notes for context handoff
- **Agent status visibility** — 5 statuses (Available, Break, Lunch, Meeting, Training) with distinct CSS color tokens per state
- **Status persistence** — Agent status survives socket reconnects via Redis; `identifyUser` Lua script preserves existing status instead of resetting to Available
- **Time-in-status tracking** — `agent_status_log` table records granular status transitions; hourly rollup job aggregates into `daily_agent_status`
- **Real-time team status panel** — QueueSidebar shows online agents with colored status dots, updated live
- **Team Status column** — AdminTeam table includes real-time agent status with colored indicators
- **Team Capacity badge** — SupportNav displays available/total agent count as a live badge
- **Live team capacity widget** — Admin dashboard widget shows utilization bar, auto-refreshes every 15 seconds
- **Agent self-view stats panel** — "My Stats" collapsible panel in SupportView with time-in-status breakdown
- **Historical availability trend** — Line chart in My Stats panel when date range spans 2+ days
- **Split View** — 2–4 chat panels side-by-side with auto-layout (2 = equal columns, 3 = primary+secondary, 4 = 2×2 grid)
- **Preview Pane** — Read-only ticket triage view with metadata summary card, last 3 messages, and Join button
- **ViewModeDropdown** — Unified layout mode switcher (Normal, Split, Preview, Focus) replacing the standalone Focus toggle
- **Compact ChatWindow mode** — Minimal header for split view panels
- **Sidebar overlay** — Hamburger toggle shows/hides sidebar in split view mode
- **Mobile transfer button** — Removed `hidden sm:block` restriction so transfer is accessible on small screens
- **Comprehensive demo seed** (`seed.ts`) — 2 partners, 20 users, 50 tickets, 200 messages, ratings, stats, KB articles
- **`accent-amber` and `accent-orange` CSS design tokens** — Used for status dot colors
- **`statusColors.ts`** — Shared utility for consistent status rendering across components
- **28 Playwright E2E tests** — Covering agent status, ticket transfer, and view modes

### Changed
- Ticket transfer targets departments, not individual agents
- `StatusPicker` emits `status:set` event (was `support:status`) to match server handler
- `identifyUser` Lua script preserves existing Redis status on reconnect (was resetting to Available)
- Queue sidebar filters out both `closed` and `resolved` tickets (was filtering `closed` only)
- `ticket.list` tRPC endpoint accepts `resolved` status and status arrays
- GDPR purge includes `agent_status_log` entries (30-day retention)
- Drizzle migration regenerated as single baseline
- Business hours set to 24/7 for demo/test purposes

### Fixed
- CommandPalette test mock type mismatch (`vi.fn()` vs `() => void`)
- Unused `afterEach` import in useKeyboardShortcuts test
- Client tsconfig missing server/types include for web-push declarations
- GDPR test mock returning wrong shape (`[]` instead of `{ rows: [] }`)
- Recharts Tooltip formatter type error in `AgentStatusStats`
- Resolved tickets appearing in the active support queue

### Database
- New table: `agent_status_log` — granular per-agent status transition records
- New table: `daily_agent_status` — pre-aggregated daily time-in-status rollup
- New table: `push_subscriptions` — Web Push subscription endpoints per user

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **AiContext dependency injection** — All AI modules use centralized DI (wired at boot) via barrel imports; `ai/redis.ts` removed in favor of shared `pubClient`
- **AI API key encryption** — AES-256-GCM encryption for AI API keys at rest (`AI_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` env var, fatal in production when AI is enabled)
- **Cursor-paginated messages** — `message.list` tRPC endpoint with "load older messages" UI
- **Centralized tenant guard** — `requirePartnerScope` / `requirePartnerScopeWith` for consistent multi-tenant query scoping
- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGTERM/SIGINT handler with clean exit path and TaskRunner mutex for background jobs
- **Instant socket revocation** — Redis Pub/Sub-based session revocation for deactivated users
- **Caddy TLS** — Production compose includes Caddy reverse proxy with automatic TLS
- **Azure AD locale extraction** — SSO login extracts locale claim for user language preference
- **Saved views** — Per-user saved ticket filter views (`saved_views` table, `savedView` tRPC router, `SavedViewPicker` component)

### Security
- Revoke refresh tokens before creating new one in `/enter-partner`
- Require authentication on `/api/v1/config` endpoint
- Prevent SSRF via webhook redirect following
- `AI_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` fatal when AI is enabled in production
- `DEMO_MODE` added to Zod config with production guard
- Handle platform operators and revoke tokens on no-membership rejection

### Performance
- Split i18n into per-locale dynamic imports
- Lazy-load `AdminStats` and `AdminSatisfaction`
- Consolidate SupportView store subscriptions with `useShallow`
- Replace unbounded `IN` clause with JOIN queries in stats
- Add DB indexes: `audit_log(created_at)`, `messages(ticket_id, created_at)`, `tickets.participants` GIN
- Hoist `getAiConfig` query from `MessageBubble` to `ChatWindow`
- Eliminate redundant DB query in `ticket.list` for support users

### Fixed
- Presence: replace TOCTOU-prone `hSetNX`/`decrementUserCount` with atomic Lua scripts
- Socket: make identify handler set `socket.data` atomically; replace module-level `listenersAttached` with `useRef`
- Auth: return `revocationFailed` flag on logout token revocation failure
- Messages: add `createdAt` fallback in sort to prevent NaN ordering
- Client: log `trpcVanilla` mutation errors instead of silently swallowing
- i18n: make `tBrowser` English-only and add missing `'en'` key

### Refactored
- Migrate CSV export query and `insertRating` to Drizzle query builder
- Extract `ticketQueries` Drizzle module with tests
- Cruft audit: prune 6 redundant deps, remove dead code, delete 33 historical markdown files

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-27

### Design System
- **Brutalist redesign** — Complete UI overhaul with CSS custom property design tokens, self-hosted JetBrains Mono + Inter fonts, and light/dark mode via `.dark` class toggle
- New utility classes: `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-danger`, `input-field`, `surface-card`, `surface-panel`, `bubble-sent`, `bubble-received`, `bubble-whisper`, `badge`, `mono-label`, `mono-id`, `mono-timestamp`, `section-header`
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant focus-visible states on all interactive elements
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support for both animations and transitions
- Self-hosted fonts (zero external CDN dependencies)
- ErrorBoundary restyled with design tokens

### Security
- **HttpOnly cookie authentication** — JWT tokens now transported via `HttpOnly SameSite=Lax Secure` cookies instead of `Authorization: Bearer` headers. Eliminates XSS token theft vector. Client no longer stores tokens in localStorage.
- `COOKIE_SECURE` defaults to `true` (set `false` for local dev without HTTPS)
- `COOKIE_DOMAIN` config for subdomain cookie sharing
- Companion `session_expires` cookie for client-side expiry detection without exposing JWT
- **PostgreSQL audit_log immutability triggers** — BEFORE UPDATE raises unconditionally, BEFORE DELETE requires prior archival

### Added
- MFA admin management: platform operators can see MFA status badges and force-disable MFA for any user
- Account unlock: platform operators can unlock locked-out users from the user table
- Email notifications for admin-initiated MFA disable and account unlock
- `REQUIRE_PLATFORM_STEP_UP` config flag (default `false`) to control platform TOTP step-up enforcement

- Socket.io token expiry detection — expired JWTs are caught and clients auto-reconnect
- CI: server unit tests now run in pipeline
- CI: migration validation against a fresh Postgres in every build
- **Advanced password policies** — min 10 chars, upper/lower/digit/special, common password blocking, email/name inclusion check
- **Password history** — prevents reuse of last 5 passwords (Argon2id verified)
- **Account lockout** — 5 failed attempts triggers 15-minute lockout with audit trail

- **Centralized email templates** — B&W design system with brand context, XSS-safe escaping
- **Cursor-based pagination** — audit log uses keyset pagination (createdAt|id) instead of offset
- **WebSocket k6 load test** — Socket.io connection stress testing (25 VUs, Engine.IO framing)
- **Playwright E2E scaffold** — password reset flow spec with config
- **MFA settings UI** — global shield button opens modal for enable/disable/recovery code management

- **Archive API endpoints** — `getArchivedAuditLog`, `getArchivedTickets` (cursor-based), `verifyAuditChain`, `runArchive` (manual trigger)
- **Self-service password change** — authenticated users can change their own password with strength validation, history check, and session revocation
- **Archive viewer UI** — PlatformView "Archive" tab with audit log browser, ticket browser, chain verification, and manual archive trigger
- CI: Playwright E2E job with Postgres service container, browser install, and failure artifact upload
- **Canned responses** — per-partner response templates with shortcut keys, category grouping, and `/` picker in chat
- **Message edit/delete** — support agents can edit or soft-delete their own messages (admins can delete any)
- **Ticket transfer** — support agents can transfer tickets to another online support user
- **Ticket search** — full-text search across message content from the queue sidebar
- **Customer info panel** — sidebar showing agent details, past tickets, and reference fields
- DB migration 0010: `canned_responses` table with `title`, `body`, `shortcut`, `category`, `created_by`
- DB migration 0011: `edited_at` and `deleted_at` columns on messages table

### Changed
- Ticket list pagination migrated from offset-based to cursor-based keyset pagination (AdminArchive, QueueSidebar)
- Build job now depends on all four CI checks (typecheck, client tests, server tests, migrations)
- Invite/reminder/test emails now use centralized `mailTemplates.ts` instead of inline HTML
